<p>Commit:</p>
<p>Time for a nice *polyptoton rhetortical figure:</p>
<p>"Cultures can be cultivated just as one cultures her own garden."</p>
<p>*Polyptoton occurs when the same word reads in different cases. Ex: "please, please me". This is all taken from Mark Forsyths' The Elements of Eloquence (Icon Books, 2013), chapter 2.</p>
